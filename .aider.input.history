+Code the following app
+```
+Role: Act as a Senior Web3 Full-Stack Engineer specializing in Farcaster Mini Apps (Frames v2), Solidity, and Next.js.
+
+Objective: Code a functional Farcaster Mini App that mimics the functionality of the PancakeSwap Lottery. The app consists of a Solidity Smart Contract (deployed on Base) and a Next.js frontend that runs inside the Farcaster client.
+
+Tech Stack:
+
+Smart Contract: Solidity ^0.8.20 (Hardhat environment).
+
+Frontend: Next.js 14 (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Lucide React.
+
+Web3 Integration: Wagmi v2, Viem, and Tanstack Query.
+
+Farcaster: @farcaster/frame-sdk for identity and context.
+
+Project Requirements:
+
+Part 1: The Smart Contract (Lottery.sol) Create a contract optimized for the Base L2 network.
+
+Variables: ticketPrice (set to 0.001 ETH), lotteryId, players array, history mapping.
+
+Functions:
+
+buyTicket(): Accepts ETH. Rejects if value is incorrect. Adds sender to array.
+
+drawWinner(): (For this MVP, use block.prevrandao or a simplified pseudo-random generator to avoid complex Chainlink setup). Selects a random index from players, transfers 90% of balance to winner, keeps 10% in contract as fee/rollover. Resets the array.
+
+getPotBalance(): Returns current contract balance.
+
+getPlayers(): Returns list of current participants.
+
+Part 2: The Mini App Frontend Create a mobile-first, responsive UI that looks similar to PancakeSwap (playful, rounded, colorful).
+
+File Structure: Please provide the code for:
+
+app/page.tsx (Main UI).
+
+app/providers.tsx (Wagmi + Query Client setup).
+
+app/layout.tsx (Including the Farcaster SDK script).
+
+public/.well-known/farcaster.json (The manifest file).
+
+Key Features:
+
+SDK Initialization: Use sdk.actions.ready() on load.
+
+UI State: Show the current "Pot Size" (read from contract).
+
+Action: A large "Buy Ticket" button.
+
+Feedback: Show a loading spinner during transaction and a "Success" confetti animation when the ticket is bought.
+
+Wallet: Assume the user is using the Farcaster-injected wallet or a standard connector via Wagmi.
+
+Output Instructions:
+
+Provide the full Solidity code for the contract.
+
+Provide the Install Command (npm install ...) for all necessary frontend dependencies.
+
+Provide the Full Code for the Next.js files listed above.
+
+Ensure the code handles the window.ethereum injection correctly for Farcaster mobile users.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
